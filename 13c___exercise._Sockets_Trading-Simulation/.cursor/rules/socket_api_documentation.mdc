- **Purpose**: Maintain consistency between the implemented Socket.IO event handlers in `server/src/socketHandlers/` and their definitions in [`sockets.md`](mdc:docs/server/api/sockets.md).

- **Trigger**: This rule is highly relevant when changes are detected in, or discussion pertains to, files within the `server/src/socketHandlers/` directory.

- **Action for AI Assistant (Cursor)**:
    - When code in `server/src/socketHandlers/` is modified or discussed (e.g., event names, payload structures, acknowledgement formats change):
        1.  **Identify Changes**: Note the specific modifications or points of discussion related to the event handlers.
        2.  **Compare with Documentation**: Review the contents of [`docs/server/api/sockets.md`](mdc:docs/server/api/sockets.md) to ascertain if it accurately reflects these changes or the current understanding.
        3.  **Recommend/Perform Updates**:
            - If discrepancies are found, or if new events/structures are implemented/discussed that are not yet documented, inform the user.
            - Propose specific updates to [`docs/server/api/sockets.md`](mdc:docs/server/api/sockets.md).
            - If requested, assist in applying these updates to the documentation file.

- **Goal**: Reinforce [`docs/server/api/sockets.md`](mdc:docs/server/api/sockets.md) as the reliable single source of truth for the project's Socket.IO communication interface, prompting updates as the implementation evolves.
